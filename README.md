# Project-HIDS

**Project-HIDS** is a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System that enhances security by combining multiple detection techniques, specifically anomaly-based and signature-based methods. This hybrid approach aims to improve the effectiveness of intrusion detection systems (IDS) by addressing the limitations inherent in individual methods, such as high false-positive rates and the inability to detect new attacks.

## üåü Features

- **Hybrid Detection Approach:** Integrates both signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods to provide comprehensive security coverage.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms to enhance the detection of known and unknown threats.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Implements robust data preprocessing techniques to prepare datasets for effective model training and evaluation.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a web-based interface for easy interaction and monitoring of intrusion detection activities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Machine Learning Libraries:** scikit-learn, pandas, numpy
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (via Flask templates)
- **Others:** Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing and model training

## üöÄ Installation

To set up and run Project-HIDS locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
