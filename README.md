# Project-HIDS
Project based on hybrid intrusion detection system .
Introduction:
Hybrid Intrusion Detection System focuses on improving intrusion detection systems (IDS) by combining multiple detection techniques(anamoly based and signature based ) to enhance security. Hybrid IDS combines signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods to address the limitations of each approach, such as high false-positive rates and inability to detect new attacks. The review highlights various hybrid models and their effectiveness in detecting intrusions, with a particular emphasis on machine learning algorithms and their applications in real-time network security.
Features:
Combination of Techniques: Integrates signature-based and anomaly-based detection methods to leverage the strengths of both.
Machine Learning Algorithms: Utilizes advanced algorithms like random forests and more for improved detection accuracy.
Real-time Detection: Focuses on real-time data analysis to identify intrusions promptly.
High Detection Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in identifying intrusions with low false-positive rates.
Scalability and Flexibility: Can be adapted to different network environments and updated with new signatures and patterns.
Technologies Used:
Front End: HTML,CSS,JavaScript
Database:MongoDB
Backend:Flask
ML ALgorithms:Random Forests.
